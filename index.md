### Fast Fourier Transform

> The Fourier series is linear algebra in infinite dimensions. The “vectors” are functions
> f(x); they are projected onto the sines and cosines; that produces the Fourier coefficients

### Redstone and our project

One of the resources available in Minecraft is Redstone. This resource is obtained in the form of 'dust' and is capable of transmitting signals and giving power to other blocks found in the game. It works in a similar way to binary, where an element can only have two values, on or off.
